# Summary and After-actions
This project was a good exercise in pulling raw data from an API and manipulating it to create an app. Structuring the app into different components and state management were crucial. Passing data and understanding the function of every element and their links to the others were key to making it operational.

### Improvements

- Style site
- Pull more concise and accurate data
- Add ethnic groups to user list where map with population density visualised
- Add visual "loading" prompts while essential data is being loaded to display
- Add visual "added to list" prompt when elements added to user list
- Rethink UIUX for "add to list" button. Possibly change text to "already on list" when clicked.
